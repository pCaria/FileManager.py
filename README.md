# FileManager.py
A python program that checks your download directory and organizes it into folders accordingly with the file extension.

IMPORTANT:

The only thing you must do to make this program work is change the source_dir, at the beginning of the code, to the path of your download folder.

In the code, you will find: source_dir = "H:\Downloads". Replace the "H\Downloads" with the path of the directory you want to organize, usually the download folder.
